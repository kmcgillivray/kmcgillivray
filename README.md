# üåü Phwish!

Hello, hello! I'm Kevin McGillivray (he/him); software engineer, [artist](https://studio.kevinmcgillivray.net), and convivial co-conspirator. For me, this is the year of the [Enchanter](https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/word/enchanter/).

## My current projects

- ü™Ñ **Enchanted Table**, a web app for practicing creativity with oracle decks
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Appleton Drawing Club**, friendly, local life drawing meetups in my town
- üçÇ **[Enchantment Supply](https://enchantment.supply)**, my art studio worldbuilding RPG

## Questions I care about

As a web developer, I work on projects that help me explore these questions. I like to focus on the things that grow with the grain of the web: accessibility, progressive enhancement, and open standards.

- **What is creativity?** What stories do we tell about creativity? [How might we practice it in its full nuance and complexity?](https://practicingcreativity.kevinmcgillivray.net)
- **How might we co-create accessible, neighborly communities?** What paths and patterns do we perceive between our homes, neighborhoods, towns, and _the web_? How can we create accessible, inclusive, human scale networks and identities, [across online and offline spaces](https://kmcgillivray.github.io/a-web-pattern-language/)?
- **How do we contribute to enchantment**, repair, and wholeness? Where does the _Quality Without a Name_ emerge and how do we enchant it in our [days](https://patternworkshop.substack.com)?

## Fun facts

- I order left handed cappuccinos
- My favorite tree is a scots pine in my neighborhood
